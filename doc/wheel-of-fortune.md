# Wheel of Fortune

## Rules

On each turn player has three choices:
1. Spin the Wheel
2. Buy a wovel
3. Guess the answer

### Spin the wheel
The wheel spin stops on a reward. There are three possible reward types:
1. Money reward: The player can now guess a consonant. If the consonant is found in the phrase, the sum the wheel lands on is added into the player's balance. After the guess the turn ends. If player guessed a consonant, they can continue on the next turn. If they did not, next player gets the next turn. 
2. Bandit: player's balance is reset to zero. Player's turn ends. 
3. Pass turn: Player's turn ends. 


### Buy a wovel
The player can buy a wovel with 250 EUR. If the wovel is found in the phrase, the player continues on the next turn. If it is not found, Next turn transfers to the next player. 

### Guess the answer
If player guesses the answer, player wins the round and gets to keep the balance they have cumulated. If the guess is incorrect, next turn is passed to the next player.
